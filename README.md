## ü§ù Hand By Hand: Charity Management System
A comprehensive, cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter, designed to revolutionize charitable work by seamlessly connecting donors and volunteers with impactful projects. It features a fully integrated financial system, including wallet management, guided Zakat calculation, and a unique Time Donation feature.

‚ú® Key Unique Features
We focused on delivering a complete and engaging donor experience:

Donate Your Time: A unique "Time Donation" feature allows donors to apply as volunteers, submit questionnaires, and track their application status directly within the app.

Targeted Zakat Management: Calculate and pay Zakat with the option to designate the amount to specific fields (Health, Education, Housing, etc.) for maximum impact.

Wallet & Automation: Fund the in-app wallet for smooth transactions, and activate the Monthly Recurring Donation feature for automated charity.

Points & Rewards: An integrated points system rewards donors for every contribution, featuring a Top Donors Leaderboard to foster community engagement.

Engagement: Browse beneficiary testimonials and send direct financial gifts to registered beneficiaries.

Secure Access: A complete Authentication flow, including OTP (One-Time Password) email verification, to ensure account security.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
The project is built following best practices to ensure performance and scalability:

Framework: Flutter

State Management:

BLoC / flutter_bloc: We chose the BLoC (Business Logic Component) architecture to achieve a clean separation of responsibilities between business logic and the UI, resulting in clean, testable, and maintainable code.

Networking and Data:

http: Handles all communications with the Backend API.

shared_preferences: Used for storing non-sensitive local data (e.g., user session tokens).

UI/UX Enhancements:

pin_code_fields: Provides a smooth and reliable UI for OTP entry during verification.

carousel_slider and smooth_page_indicator: Used for attractive, professional sliders and indicators.

flutter_spinkit: Adds high-quality loading animations (Loaders) during network operations.

Utilities:

intl: Used for accurate formatting of currencies and dates according to local standards.
